**I am looking for internship oppertunities for 2023 summer!**

Hi, I am Zhilin Wang, a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer and Information Science at Purdue University Indianapolis, Indiana, USA. I got my Bachelor's degree from Nanchang University in June 2020, and I started my Ph.D. in January 2021. My research interests include Federated Learning, Edge Computing, Blockchain, Optimization Theory, and Game Theory. I'm in my third year as a Ph.D. student, and my supervisor is Dr. Qin Hu. I am the reviewer of 2022 IEEE ICC, IEEE Access, IEEE TPDS, IEEE IoTJ, Elsevier HCC, and JNCA,  and I also serve as the TPC member for IEEE ICC 2022 Workshop. 


If you have any interest in conducting research with me, please feel free to email me and we can schedule a meeting to discuss the potential opportunity.
