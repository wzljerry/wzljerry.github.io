## Introduction

Hi, I am Zhilin Wang, a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer and Information Science at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI), Indiana, USA. I got my Bachelor's degree from Nanchang University in June 2020, and I enrolled at IUPUI in January 2021. My research interests include Federated Learning, Edge Computing, the Internet of Things, Blockchain, Optimization Theory, and Game Theory. I'm in my second year as a Ph.D. student, and my supervisor is Dr. Qin Hu. I am the reviewer of 2022 IEEE ICC, IEEE Access, IEEE TPDS, IEEE IoTJ, and JNCA,  and I also serve as the TPC member for IEEE ICC 2022 Workshop.
