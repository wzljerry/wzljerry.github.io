**Hiring! We are looking for a talented Software Engineer and a Data Engineer!** 

I am expected to graduate in December 2024. 

<!-- I built OpenJobs, the leading AI-powered job search engine. -->

I am Zhilin Wang, currently in my final year as a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science at Purdue University, Indiana, USA. I'm also affiliated with [CERIAS](https://www.cerias.purdue.edu/) at Purdue. 

I obtained my bachelor's degree at Nanchang University in June 2020 and my Ph.D. at Purdue University in December 2024. I am co-advised by [Prof. Qin Hu](https://cs.iupui.edu/~qinhu/?_gl=1*5xczlx*_ga*MTk3MTQ5NTQ4Ni4xNjYwMzg5NDUy*_ga_61CH0D2DQW*MTY3Nzg0MTM1MS4xOS4wLjE2Nzc4NDEzNTEuMC4wLjA.) and [Prof. Snehasis Mukhopadhyay](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/faculty/smukhop.html).
I've actively contributed as a reviewer for prestigious academic journals and conferences such as IEEE TPDS, IEEE IoTJ, Elsevier JNCA, IEEE TCCN, and IEEE ICC. Additionally, I was a member of the Technical Program Committee (TPC) for the IEEE ICC'22 Workshop. My research interests are briefly described below:

- Decentralized Machine Learning. Implementing blockchain to achieve decentralized federated learning focuses on addressing resource allocation challenges on local and edge devices and straggler mitigation in a hierarchical system.
- Robust Machine Learning. Revealing the vulnerabilities of existing security mechanisms in federated learning and proposing lightweight and general schemes to protect industrial federated learning systems. 
- Efficient Mobile Edge Computing. Designing efficient resource-sharing schemes to facilitate computational resource allocation on mobile edge servers.
- Large-scale Distributed Optimization. Designing efficient and robust distributed algorithms to solve large-scale optimization problems.
- Security & Privacy in Large Language Models. Toward improving the security and privacy protection of large language models during training and application.

In general, my research focuses on the system design, network optimization, and security protection of AI systems. If you are interested in my research, please directly email me.
